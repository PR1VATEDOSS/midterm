Define all possible 3x3 magic squares:

There are exactly 8 possible 3x3 magic squares.

Store them as 1D arrays of length 9.

Initialize minCost = Infinity

This will keep track of the minimal transformation cost.

Flatten the input matrix s into a 1D array flatS

This makes it easier to compare element by element.

Loop through each magic square in the list:
a. Set cost = 0 for the current magic square.
b. Loop through each of the 9 elements:

Add the absolute difference between the corresponding element of flatS and the magic square to cost.
c. Update minCost:

minCost = minimum of minCost and cost.

After checking all magic squares, return minCost

This is the minimal total cost to convert s into a magic square.
