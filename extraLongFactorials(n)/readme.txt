Initialize a BigInt variable for the result:

result = 1n → Start with 1 as BigInt to handle large numbers

Loop through numbers from 2 to n:

For each integer i from 2 to n:

Convert i to BigInt → BigInt(i)

Multiply result by i

Store the product back in result

Output the factorial:

Convert result to string

Print or return the string representation
